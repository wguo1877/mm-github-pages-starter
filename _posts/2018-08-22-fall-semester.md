title: Goals for the year
---

Some quick goals for myself this year:
* Read more about do-calculus and causal inference
* Get more involved in research and understand if it is something I want to pursue more seriously
* Have a more regimented physical therapy schedule so I can play sports without pain again
* Spend less time on my phone
* Make the volleyball club more competitive again
* Have more fun!
