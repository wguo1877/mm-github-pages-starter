title: Rice University Graduate

My name is William Guo, although I go by Billy, and I'm a recent graduate from Rice University studying Computer Science and Mathematical Economic Analysis.
I'm interested in applied econometrics and seeing whether its approach to causal inference can be extended to more prediction-based fields like machine learning. I also am part of Professor Jermaine's jointly-led <a href="http://issyl.rice.edu/">Intelligent Software Systems Laboratory</a>, where I am working on deep learning methods for program synthesis. I'm also a huge Federer fan.
